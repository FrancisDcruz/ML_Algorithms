Write a Python program that determines the column with the
best split for the CART decision tree algorithm. You don't
have to write the CART algorithm in its entirety. You just
have to write a program that will traverse all columns in the
data and output the column and the threshold that gives the
lowest gini index.

The input should be the data file and labels as in previous
assignments. You should output the column number k, split
value s and the gini index corresponding to that split.

An example output;

Best split for column 5 at 0.3284 with gini index 0.37181996086105673
