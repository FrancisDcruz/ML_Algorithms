Write a Python program to output a k-means clustering of the dataset. 
The input to your program is a data file and number of clusters k. Note the label file is not required as it is an unsupervised learning algorithm.
The output is in the same format as label files we have been using
in the course. So if the clustering is C0 = {0, 2, 3}, C1 = {1, 4}
and C2 = {5} then the output would be
0 0
1 1
0 2
0 3
1 4
2 5
